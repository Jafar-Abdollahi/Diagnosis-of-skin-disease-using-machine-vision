Skin diseases are more common than other diseases. Skin diseases may be caused by fungal infection, bacteria, allergy, or viruses, etc. The advancement of lasers and Photonics based medical technology has made it possible to diagnose the skin diseases much more quickly and accurately. But the cost of such diagnosis is still limited and very expensive. So, image processing techniques help to build automated screening system for dermatology at an initial stage. The extraction of features plays a key role in helping to classify skin diseases. Computer vision has a role in the detection of skin diseases in a variety of techniques. 

In this the skin images are given into the system for processing. The input image is subjected to image processing process like pre-processing, feature extraction and machine learning based classifier to predict skin disease or not and recommend medicinal guidance based on the skin disease stage.

<h2> Dataset </h2>
We compiled our dataset by collecting images from different websites specific to skin diseases. The database has 80 images of every disease (20 Normal images, 20 Melanoma images, 20 Eczema images and 20 Psoriasis images).
Fig 1 shows some of the sample images from our dataset.

<h2> Methods </h2>
In this section, the methodology of the proposed system for detection, extraction and classification of skin diseases images is described. The system will help significantly in the detection of melanoma, Eczema and Psoriasis. The whole architecture can be divided into several modules comprising of preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The block diagram of the system is shown in Fig 2.

<h2> Conlusion </h2>
The development of AI-based diagnoses of skin lesions is a research area of great interest, which benefits from appropriate methodologies and abundant datasets that are continuously updated. Despite the progress made in the last decade, many aspects still require further investigation and improvement.
In this paper, we review methods for the segmentation and classification of skin lesions using ML and DL, and discuss the current state of research, its challenges, and future directions for DL-driven dermatological diagnosis. These studies help to enhance the development of advanced concepts and methods. In summary, there is a need for establishing more standard datasets, developing more visualization tools, innovating model architectures, and fusing multiple techniques in the future to comply with the trends of dermatological image segmentation and classification. There is a particular need to develop more reliable automated diagnostic methods when faced with an increasing variety of clinical data.
